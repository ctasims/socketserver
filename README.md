socketserver
============
Cianan Sims and Jason Rose

All our server code is in server.py
client.py is an old client (ignore it).
boss.py is our script for running the GENERATE and GET commands for Types 2 and 3.
I run my servers on my endpoints and use my router to give them the GENERATE and GET commands.
One endpoint generates the data and the other endpoint gets it.

to run these, just type 'python server.py' in bash.
